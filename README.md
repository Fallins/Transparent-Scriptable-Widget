# There's something better waiting for you...
I wrote this script after a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/j1o6v4/automatically_create_transparent_widgets_with/) ended up gaining more interest than I anticipated. However, I've since created [__Weather Cal__](https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal), which is much more flexible, has way more options, and is actively maintained.

I'll leave this project as-is, and you're of course welcome to use it. But I'd recommend checking out Weather Cal instead. Have fun scripting!
